        <h1>AUTOMATIC DOOR WITH REMOTE LOCKING</h1>
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>This project aimed to design and implement an automatic door system with remote control locking
        using Raspberry Pi 3, an ultrasonic sensor, and a keypad. The system was capable of opening and
        closing based on the proximity of individuals detected by the ultrasonic sensor. Additionally, it
        integrated a remote-control locking mechanism through the Blynk mobile application, allowing
        authorized users to securely lock and unlock the door from anywhere. In the event of internet failure,
        a backup password system enabled manual access. The project involved hardware setup, software
        development, integration of components, and thorough testing to ensure functionality and reliability.
        The key features included enhanced security, convenience, and remote accessibility, contributing to
        advancements in IoT-based access control systems.</p>

        <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
        <p>Existing Automatic Door Systems:
            Automatic door systems have been widely adopted in various applications such as commercial
            buildings, hospitals, and retail establishments due to their convenience and accessibility features.
            Research by Ogunnusi, A. O. et al. (2019) provides an in-depth analysis of different types of
            automatic door systems, including sliding doors, swinging doors, and revolving doors. These systems
            typically utilize motion sensors or proximity sensors to detect the presence of individuals and trigger
            the opening or closing of the door.
            Remote Locking Mechanisms:
            Remote locking mechanisms offer the convenience of controlling access to doors remotely, often
            through mobile applications or web interfaces. Research by Huang, T. H. et al. (2020) explores the
            implementation of a remote locking system for smart homes using IoT technology. The system allows
            users to lock and unlock doors using a smartphone app, enhancing security and accessibility.
            Projects Utilizing Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Sensors, and Keypads:
            Several projects have utilized Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensors, and keypads to create intelligent
            access control systems. For instance, a project by Smith, J. (2018) demonstrates the development of a
            Raspberry Pi-based automatic door opener using ultrasonic sensors for proximity detection and a
            keypad for manual access control.
            Another project by Patel, K. (2020) showcases a Raspberry Pi-controlled smart door lock system that
            integrates ultrasonic sensors and a keypad for access control. The system also features remote locking
            capabilities through a mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Design Activities</h2>
        <p>The methodology for designing and implementing the automatic door system with remote control
            locking involved several key steps. Initially, the necessary hardware components, including a
            Raspberry Pi 3, ultrasonic sensor, keypad, and servo motor, were acquired. The ultrasonic sensor
            was then connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to enable proximity detection, and the keypad
            was interfaced with the Raspberry Pi to allow for manual access control. The servo motor was
            installed and configured to manage the door mechanism effectively.
            For the software development phase, the project utilized the Python programming language to write
            the necessary code for the Raspberry Pi. This included interfacing with the ultrasonic sensor and
            keypad to capture sensor data and process keypad inputs. Additionally, the Blynk API was employed
            to facilitate communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Blynk mobile application, enabling
            remote control functionality. The software incorporated logic to control the door operation
            automatically based on proximity detection and remote locking/unlocking commands received via a
            website.
            Integration of the hardware and software components was a critical step to ensure the system's proper
            functionality. The hardware components were integrated with the software system to ensure seamless
            communication between devices. The Raspberry Pi was configured to run the software automatically
            upon startup, allowing for uninterrupted operation of the automatic door system. Testing of the
            integrated system was conducted to confirm that all components worked together as intended.
            The final phase involved comprehensive testing and debugging. The system was tested under various
            scenarios, including proximity detection, manual access via the keypad, and remote control via the
            Blynk mobile application. Any software or hardware issues identified during testing were addressed
            through thorough debugging procedures. The reliability and performance of the system were validated
            to ensure it met the projectâ€™s requirements and objectives.
            Throughout the entire process, meticulous attention was given to documentation, including hardware
            schematics, software code, and testing results. Regular communication and collaboration among team
            members were maintained to facilitate efficient progress and effective problem-solving. By adhering
            to this methodology, the automatic door system with remote control locking was successfully
            designed, implemented, and validated to provide a reliable and functional solution.</p>
